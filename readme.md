# lib-dependency-tools

This library provides a set of tools for runtime visibility of a Java application:

* dependencies (direct and transitive),
* dependency versions,
* licenses.

In order to achieve this, we ask Maven to add some extra information into the application artifact during the normal build process. 

## Maven plugins

Maven has a large ecosystem of plugins that can extend the normal build process. In particular, here we use

* the dependency plugin and its `tree` goal to collect the dependency hierarchy
    * This goal can be tried on any Maven project by running `mvn dependency:tree`. 
* Maven license plugin and the `download-licenses` goal
    * This goal can be tried on any Maven project by running `mvn license:download-licenses`. By default the output gets 
    saved in `target/generated-resources`. The XML file `licenses.xml` has a machine readable list of dependencies and thei
    associated licenses. The actual license files are in `target/generated-resources/licenses`.

## Class hierarchy

This library reads dependency information into a set of immutable DTOs that are in the `model` package.

## How to use
 
Two steps to get this working:

1. **write** the dependency/license info into the target artifact (see _POM file additions_) 
2. **read** this information in your application at runtime. 
    1. Include this library as a dependency. At runtime, call `AppMetadata.getInstance()` which provides an entry point 
    to dependency and license information. See the unit tests for usage examples.  

### POM file additions

The Maven POM file top-level project has to be 'enriched' with the following in the `build` section. 

```xml
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.1.1</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <configuration>
              <outputFile>${project.build.directory}/classes/META-INF/build/dependency-tree.txt</outputFile>
            </configuration>
            <phase>compile</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>tree</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>license-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.17</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <configuration>
              <licensesOutputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/classes/META-INF/build/licenses</licensesOutputDirectory>
              <licensesOutputFile>${project.build.directory}/classes/META-INF/build/licenses.xml</licensesOutputFile>
            </configuration>
            <phase>compile</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>download-licenses</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
```

Note that the required Maven goals are run during the `compile` phase of the build. In order to have these files available 
(e.g. when running the unit tests) one must first run a Maven build (`mvn package`). 

### Writing the application version into the Manifest file

This is an optional step but can be useful in some contexts. This allows retrieving the application version using code:

```java
SomeClass.class.getPackage().getImplementationVersion();
```

For this to work (return non-null), the Maven JAR plugin (or the WAR plugin, for Java EE Web projects) have to be 
asked to include this information. For Java JAR projects:

```xml
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <archive>
            <manifest>
              <addDefaultImplementationEntries>true</addDefaultImplementationEntries>
              <addDefaultSpecificationEntries>true</addDefaultSpecificationEntries>
            </manifest>
          </archive>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
```

For WAR projects:

```xml
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <archive>
            <manifest>
              <addDefaultImplementationEntries>true</addDefaultImplementationEntries>
              <addDefaultSpecificationEntries>true</addDefaultSpecificationEntries>
            </manifest>
          </archive>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
```
